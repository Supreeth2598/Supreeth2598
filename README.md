👋 Hi, I’m @Supreeth2598

👀 I’m interested in lab-on-a-chip systems, biosensors, MEMS, microfluidics, and optical electronic systems.
🌱 I’m currently working on immunodiagnostic platforms for Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) using chemiluminescence-based lateral flow assays.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on healthcare diagnostics, wearable sensing systems, and research-to-product translation in resource-limited settings.

⚡ Fun fact: I once built a burglar alarm from scrap parts before I knew what an op-amp was—and it worked!
